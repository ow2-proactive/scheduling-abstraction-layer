### 10.1- DefineCluster endpoint:

**Description**: This endpoint is used to define a Kubernetes cluster deployment.
Script templates for configuring the deployment workflow are available [here](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/tree/master/docker/scripts). They can be modified to incorporate user-defined Kubernetes installation scripts, and for public clouds they need to have installed and set the network component. Additionally, they enable the installation of various software components within the cluster. Environmental variables required for specific configurations, along with their values, can be passed as part of the cluster definition. Before using this endpoint, ensure that cloud or edge nodes are added and selected for deployment execution.

Cluster definition is the instance of class [Cluster](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/sal-common/src/main/java/org/ow2/proactive/sal/model/ClusterDefinition.java) that you can import from the `sal-common` package

**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¡ POST {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** A JSON body following this format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "{{cluster_name}}",
    "master-node": "{{master_name}}",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "nodeName": "{{master_name}}",
        "nodeCandidateId": "{{MasterNodeCandidate}}",
        "cloudId": "{{cloud_name}}"
      },
      {
        "nodeName": "{{worker_name}}",
        "nodeCandidateId": "{{WorkerNodeCandidate}}",
        "cloudId": "{{cloud_name}}"
      }
    ],
    "env-var":{
      "{{env_var_name1}}":"{{env_var_value1}}",
      "{{env_var_name2}}":"{{env_var_value2}}"
    }
  }
]
```

**Reply:** Boolean, `true` if successful

The `env-var` section in the JSON body can be used to define environment variables necessary for the cluster. Variables should follow the format `"ENV_VAR_NAME": "ENV_VAR_VALUE"`. For example:
- `"APPLICATION_ID": "0fb75671-8955-4c06-9a8c-d397b29e3894"`

These variables can be customized to suit the configuration and software requirements for the specific Kubernetes cluster deployment.

When defining nodes within a cluster, each node should be represented as an instance of
the [IaasNode](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/sal-common/src/main/java/org/ow2/proactive/sal/model/IaasNode.java) class,
which can be imported from the `sal-common` package. An example of the node structure is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "nodeName": "master-node-name",
    "nodeCandidateId": "{{MasterNodeCandidate}}",
    "cloudId": "given cloud name or 'edge'"
  }

]
```

***Important Considerations:***

- *Cluster Name Length:*
The cluster name should be kept relatively short, as it will be included in the names of the cluster nodes. Note that many cloud providers impose restrictions on the length of node names, so it's essential to ensure compatibility with these limits.
Also, must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

- *Node Name Requirements:*
Node names must adhere to Internet hostname conventions, allowing only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, and must start with a letter.
Node names must be globally unique across all clusters defined within the system.

- *Node Candidate ID (`nodeCandidateId`):*
For edge devices, the `nodeCandidateId` is returned when [registering the device](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/4-edge-endpoints.md#41--registernewedgenode-endpoint).
It can be retrieved for both, edge and cloud nodes, by querying system using [findNodeCandidates](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/7-node-endpoints.md#71--findnodecandidates-endpoint) endpoint.

- *Cloud ID (cloudId):*
This value should reflect the name of the [registered cloud provider](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/2-cloud-endpoints.md#21--addcloud-endpoint).
For edge devices, the cloudId should be set to `EDGE`.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your node configurations are compatible with both the SAL platform and various cloud provider requirements.



### 10.2- DeployCluster endpoint:

**Description**: This endpoint enables users to configure and deploy a Kubernetes cluster on the ProActive server.
The deployment process involves:
- Cluster Definition Integration:
The cluster configuration is integrated into script templates to generate a ProActive workflow.
- Workflow Execution:
You can monitor the execution of the workflow via the [GetCluster](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#103--getcluster-endpoint) endpoint or directly within the [ProActive Dashboard and Scheduler](https://try.activeeon.com/).
- Resource Monitoring:
Resource nodes and their deployment progress can be tracked in the [ProActive Resource Manager](https://try.activeeon.com/).

This endpoint provides a robust testing environment for SAL users,

SAL allow direct modifications to scripts for users. To test and customize both script-based and non-script-based tasks:
- Access the [ProActive Workflow Studio](https://try.activeeon.com/):
From the ProActive Dashboard, open the workflow definition in the Workflow Studio. Here, you can edit scripts within workflow tasks and directly modify non-script-based tasks.
- Script and Task Modification:
[Scripts](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/tree/master/docker/scripts) can be customized to modify task behavior, adjust configurations, or add new functionalities. Additionally, non-scripted parts of the workflow (those tasks not loaded from scripts) can also be edited directly in the Workflow Studio. This allows users to test modifications immediately and verify their validity.
- Testing and Custom Workflow Requests:
Once modifications are made, you can execute the workflow to observe performance, view task logs, and ensure functionality. If any adjustments to non-scripted tasks are successful, users can request a customized version of the workflow for future deployments.
- Monitoring and Log Examination:
After executing updated tasks, you can monitor task execution and examine detailed logs for each individual task in the Scheduler, providing in-depth testing and debugging capabilities.


Itâ€™s essential to maintain consistency between any modifications to environmental variables and their corresponding values in the code.
By following these steps, users have complete flexibility to deploy, test, and refine both script-based and non-scripted tasks within their Kubernetes clusters on ProActive. The Workflow Studio offers a powerful environment for on-the-fly edits and full execution visibility.

### 10.3- GetCluster endpoint:

**Description**:
This endpoint retrieves detailed information about the Kubernetes cluster deployment. It provides real-time status updates on the deployment progress for each individual node, as well as the overall cluster. This information allows users to monitor the deployment process, track node-specific statuses, and verify the current state of the entire cluster.

**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¢ GET {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** None

**Reply:** JSON format represented with the [ClusterNodeDefinition](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/sal-common/src/main/java/org/ow2/proactive/sal/model/ClusterNodeDefinition.java) and status values corresponding to ones observed in ProActive dashboard.


### 10.4- ManageApplication endpoint:

**Description**:
This endpoint is used to deploy and manage applications within a specific Kubernetes cluster, utilizing kubectl, KubeVela, or Helm. Upon initiating a deployment, the endpoint generates an application deployment workflow within the designated cluster, which can then be monitored and managed directly in ProActive.

**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¡ POST {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}/app
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** Json input following this format:

    "packageManager" : "kubevela",
    "appName" : "{{app_name}}",
    "action" : "apply",
    "flags" : ""
  }
]
```


**Reply:**  Long indicating the submitted Job Id of ProActive (Generated workflow in Proactive)

Once you've initiated a deployment using the ManageApplication endpoint, you can check the status of the application deployment by using the submitted Job ID returned in the response. To check the current state of the deployment workflow, use the [GetJobState endpoint.](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/5-job-endpoints.md#56--getjobstate-endpoint)


- `appFile`: This field contains the deployment definition in YAML format. It includes application metadata, component specifications, environment variables, and policies for deployment.

- `packageManager`: Specifies the package management tool to use for deployment. Acceptable values are `"kubevela"`, `"kubectl"`, or `"helm"`.

- `appName`: A string representing the name of the application. Note that the name must be valid as a filename, so avoid using spaces, quotes, or special characters.

- `action`: Specifies the action to perform. Use `"apply"` for both initial deployment and ongoing management (e.g., scaling the application).

- `flags`: Optional field to add any additional flags needed for the deployment command.

Note that from the `appFile` the value of `{{app_component_name}}` is used when calling [LabelNode](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#108--labelnode-endpoint) endpoint. Also, it is to include `\n` characters at the end of each line to indicate line breaks (JSON requirement).

### 10.5- DeleteCluster endpoint:

**Description**: This endpoint allows users to delete an existing Kubernetes cluster deployment. It removes all resources associated with the specified cluster, including nodes, network configurations, and any deployed applications. By using this endpoint, users can clean up and release the resources used by the cluster.



**Path:**

```url
ðŸ”´ DEL {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** None


**Reply:**  Boolean, `true` if successful


### 10.6- ScaleOut endpoint:

**Description**: This endpoint allows users to dynamically expand their Kubernetes cluster by adding new worker nodes.
This scaling operation is based on existing worker node definitions and is critical when increasing the cluster's capacity to support more replicas for applications.
Each worker node is introduced using the existing worker node candidate, but is uniquely identified by its `nodeName`. The number of nodes added corresponds to the number of replicas the user wishes to create.
For example, if a user wants to increase the number of replicas from 1 to 3, they could call the ScaleOut endpoint to add two more worker nodes (e.g., `worker2`, `worker3`), ensuring the cluster can support the desired number of replicas.

After the ScaleOut operation, the new worker nodes and their status can be tracked using the [GetCluster](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#103--getcluster-endpoint) endpoint or monitored in the ProActive. The created workflows correspond to the one which is used to initial node deployments in cluster, using user defined scripts.
When the new nodes are deployed, the [LabelNodes](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#108--labelnode-endpoint) endpoint should be used to label these nodes (e.g., `worker2_name`, `worker3_name`) for identification and management purposes.
To complete ScaleOut process, [ManageApplication](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#104--manageapplication-endpoint) endpoint is to be called, with updated number of the replicas (e.g. by adding two new replicas).


**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¡ POST {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}/scaleout
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** Json input following this format:

```json
[
  {
    "nodeName": "{{new_worker2_name}}",
    "nodeCandidateId": "{{WorkerNodeCandidate}}",
    "cloudId": "{{cloud_name}}"
  },
  {
    "nodeName": "{{new_worker3_name}}",
    "nodeCandidateId": "{{WorkerNodeCandidate}}",
    "cloudId": "{{cloud_name}}"
  }
]
```

**Reply:** JSON format represented with the [ClusterNodeDefinition](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/sal-common/src/main/java/org/ow2/proactive/sal/model/ClusterNodeDefinition.java) and status values corresponding to ones observed in ProActive dashboard.

- `nodeName`: The unique name for each new worker node to be added. It must follow naming conventions (no spaces, special characters, or uppercase letters), as this will be used as part of the cluster node identifier.

- `nodeCandidateId`: The ID of the existing worker node candidate, which serves as a template for the new nodes.

- `cloudId`: Identifier for the cloud environment where the new worker nodes will be deployed.

It is possible to add as many worker nodes as needed for new application replicas in one call.

### 10.7- ScaleIn endpoint:

**Description**:
This endpoint allows users to remove specific worker nodes from a Kubernetes cluster. This operation is essential for efficiently managing cluster resources, especially when scaling down applications or reconfiguring the cluster architecture. By invoking this endpoint, you can effectively decommission nodes that are no longer needed or are underutilized.

Before invoking the ScaleIn endpoint, ensure that the workloads on `worker_name` have been migrated to other nodes, by using the [LabelNodes](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#108--labelnode-endpoint) endpoint to mark it as unavailable and using ManageApplication endpoint to reduce the number of the application replicas.

After the ScaleIn operation, the removal of worker nodes and their status can be tracked using the [GetCluster](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#103--getcluster-endpoint) endpoint or monitored in the ProActive. The created workflows correspond to the one which is used to remove nodes during [DeleteCluster](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#105--deletecluster-endpoint) operation.,

**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¡ POST {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}/scalein
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** Json input following this format:

```json
[
  "{{worker_name}}",
  "{{worker_name2}}"
]
```

**Reply:** JSON format represented with the [ClusterNodeDefinition](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/sal-common/src/main/java/org/ow2/proactive/sal/model/ClusterNodeDefinition.java) and status values corresponding to ones observed in ProActive dashboard.

Note that the worker names should correspond to existing ones in the cluster, otherwise the operation will be rejected.

### 10.8- LabelNode endpoint:

**Description**: This endpoint allows users to manage node labels within a Kubernetes cluster by adding, modifying, or removing labels. Labels are key-value pairs that categorize nodes, making it easier to target specific nodes for application deployment, scaling, or management tasks.
Using LabelNodes, you can dynamically adjust labels on worker nodes as you manage scaling operations. During [ScaleOut](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#106--scaleout-endpoint), nodes are labeled to mark them as available for application deployments. Before invoking [ScaleIn](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#107--scalein-endpoint), labels can be updated to indicate that certain nodes should no longer be scheduled for application workloads, preparing them for safe removal.

**Path:**

```url
ðŸŸ¡ POST {{protocol}}://{{sal_host}}:{{sal_port}}/sal/cluster/{{cluster_name}}/label
```

**Headers:** `sessionid`

**Body:** Json input following this format:

```json
[
  {
    "{{worker2_name}}":"{{domain_prefix}}/{{app_component_name}}=yes",
    "{{worker_name}}":"{{domain_prefix}}/{{app_component_name}}=no"
  }
]
```

**Reply:** Long indicating the submitted Job Id (Generated workflow in Proactive)

Once you've initiated a labeling using the LabelNode endpoint, you can check the status of the application deployment by using the submitted Job ID returned in the response. To check the current state of the deployment workflow, use the [GetJobState endpoint.](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/5-job-endpoints.md#56--getjobstate-endpoint)


- _Node Name (Key)_: The name of the node to which the label is being added or updated. Each node name should correspond to a node deployed in the cluster.
Example node names might include `worker2_name` when labeling for workload readiness or `worker_name` when preparing for scaling down.
- _Label (Value)_: The label applied to the node is structured in a `key=value` format, where:

  - `key`: Typically consists of a custom domain prefix followed by the application component name which is passed in ManageApplication endpoint. `domain_prefix` functions as a unique namespace to avoid conflicts, especially in multi-tenant environments. It ensures that the label applies specifically to your application, component, or organization.
  - `value`: Use `yes` to indicate that the node is ready for application deployment and `no` to mark it for removal during scaling operations.

***Usage scenarios:***
  - _Scaling Out_:
  Use the [ScaleOut](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#106--scaleout-endpoint) endpoint to add new worker nodes to the cluster.
  Label the new node (e.g., `worker2_name`) with `yes`, which signals that the node is available for application workloads.
  Deploy applications using DeployApplication, which targets nodes labeled with `yes`. This ensures that replicas are scheduled only on nodes intended for the application.
  - _Preparing for Scaling In_:
  Update the label on the original node (e.g., `worker_name`) to `no` before initiating the ScaleIn process. This marks the node as unavailable for new application replicas. It is also to call ManageApplication to remove application replicas from the node.
  Finally, call [ScaleIn](https://github.com/ow2-proactive/scheduling-abstraction-layer/blob/master/endpoints/10-cluster-endpoints.md#107--scalein-endpoint) with the node name in the following format, which safely removes the node from the cluster:

***Important Notes:***
  Ensure that the environmental variables and application components are consistent across all endpoints for smooth scaling and management operations.
